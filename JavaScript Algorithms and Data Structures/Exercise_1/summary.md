# Pyramid Generator Summary

## Overview
In this interactive JavaScript session, we explored how to dynamically build a centered pyramid using ASCII characters, emphasizing logical thinking with loops, conditions, and array manipulation. The pyramid evolves in complexity through various steps, showcasing inverted variants and loop refactoring.

## ðŸ§± Core Concepts Learned

### 1. **String Manipulation & Repeat**
We utilized `.repeat()` to construct rows:
```js
" ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber)
character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1)
```
This constructs a symmetric pyramid row with leading and trailing spaces.

### 2. **Building the Pyramid with Loops**
Using `for` and `while` loops, we built the rows and pushed them into an array:
```js
for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```
Or with a while loop:
```js
let done = 0;
while (done < count) {
  done++;
  rows.push(padRow(done, count));
}
```

### 3. **Inversion Logic with Array.unshift()**
To invert the pyramid (i.e., largest row at the top), we used `unshift()` to prepend rows:
```js
if (inverted) {
  rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
} else {
  rows.push(padRow(i, count));
}
```

### 4. **Conditionals (if, else if, else)**
You learned how to control flow using conditions, and how JavaScript handles truthy and falsy values:
- `false`, `0`, `""`, `undefined`, `null`, and `NaN` are falsy
- Non-zero numbers, strings, and objects are truthy

### 5. **Equality Operators**
- `==` allows type coercion: `"0" == 0` â†’ true
- `===` checks both value and type strictly: `"0" === 0` â†’ false

## ðŸ§ª Final Code Example
```js
const character = "!";
const count = 10;
const rows = [];
let inverted = false;

function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
}

for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  } else {
    rows.push(padRow(i, count));
  }
}

let result = "";
for (const row of rows) {
  result += row + "\n";
}

console.log(result);
```

## âœ¨ What You Can Build Next
- Toggleable pyramid direction with a button (if you add HTML/JS frontend)
- Customizable character input
- Animated pyramid rendering
- Pyramid with colors using console styling or browser DOM

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways
- Practice makes pattern recognition easier (ex: 2 * row - 1 logic)
- Always use `===` unless you have a reason to coerce types
- `.push()` vs `.unshift()` can drastically change output order
- Loop design (for/while) depends on how you want to control iteration
